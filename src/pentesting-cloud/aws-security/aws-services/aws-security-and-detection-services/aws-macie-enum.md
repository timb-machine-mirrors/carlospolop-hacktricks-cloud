## Macie

Amazon Macie stands out as a service designed to **automatically detect, classify, and identify data** within an AWS account. It leverages **machine learning** to continuously monitor and analyze data, primarily focusing on detecting and alerting against unusual or suspicious activities by examining **cloud trail event** data and user behavior patterns.

Key Features of Amazon Macie:

1. **Active Data Review**: Employs machine learning to review data actively as various actions occur within the AWS account.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies irregular activities or access patterns, generating alerts to mitigate potential data exposure risks.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automatically monitors and detects new data in Amazon S3, employing machine learning and artificial intelligence to adapt to data access patterns over time.
4. **Data Classification with NLP**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to classify and interpret different data types, assigning risk scores to prioritize findings.
5. **Security Monitoring**: Identifies security-sensitive data, including API keys, secret keys, and personal information, helping to prevent data leaks.

Amazon Macie is a **regional service** and requires the 'AWSMacieServiceCustomerSetupRole' IAM Role and an enabled AWS CloudTrail for functionality.

### Alert System

Macie categorizes alerts into predefined categories like:

- Anonymized access
- Data compliance
- Credential Loss
- Privilege escalation
- Ransomware
- Suspicious access, etc.

These alerts provide detailed descriptions and result breakdowns for effective response and resolution.

### Dashboard Features

The dashboard categorizes data into various sections, including:

- S3 Objects (by time range, ACL, PII)
- High-risk CloudTrail events/users
- Activity Locations
- CloudTrail user identity types, and more.

### User Categorization

Users are classified into tiers based on the risk level of their API calls:

- **Platinum**: High-risk API calls, often with admin privileges.
- **Gold**: Infrastructure-related API calls.
- **Silver**: Medium-risk API calls.
- **Bronze**: Low-risk API calls.

### Identity Types

Identity types include Root, IAM user, Assumed Role, Federated User, AWS Account, and AWS Service, indicating the source of requests.

### Data Classification

Data classification encompasses:

- Content-Type: Based on detected content type.
- File Extension: Based on file extension.
- Theme: Categorized by keywords within files.
- Regex: Categorized based on specific regex patterns.

The highest risk among these categories determines the file's final risk level.

### Research and Analysis

Amazon Macie's research function allows for custom queries across all Macie data for in-depth analysis. Filters include CloudTrail Data, S3 Bucket properties, and S3 Objects. Moreover, it supports inviting other accounts to share Amazon Macie, facilitating collaborative data management and security monitoring.

### Enumeration

```
# Get buckets
aws macie2 describe-buckets

# Org config
aws macie2 describe-organization-configuration

# Get admin account (if any)
aws macie2 get-administrator-account
aws macie2 list-organization-admin-accounts # Run from the management account of the org

# Get macie account members (run this form the admin account)
aws macie2 list-members

# Check if automated sensitive data discovey is enabled
aws macie2 get-automated-discovery-configuration

# Get findings
aws macie2 list-findings
aws macie2 get-findings --finding-ids <ids>
aws macie2 list-findings-filters
aws macie2 get -findings-filters --id <id>

# Get allow lists
aws macie2 list-allow-lists
aws macie2 get-allow-list --id <id>

# Get different info
aws macie2 list-classification-jobs
aws macie2 list-classification-scopes
aws macie2 list-custom-data-identifiers
```

#### Post Exploitation

> [!TIP]
> From an attackers perspective, this service isn't made to detect the attacker, but to detect sensitive information in the stored files. Therefore, this service might **help an attacker to find sensitive info** inside the buckets.\
> However, maybe an attacker could also be interested in disrupting it in order to prevent the victim from getting alerts and steal that info easier.
