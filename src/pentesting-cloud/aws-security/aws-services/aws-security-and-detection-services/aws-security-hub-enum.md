# AWS - Security Hub Enum

{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Security Hub

**Security Hub** collects security **data** from **across AWS accounts**, services, and supported third-party partner products and helps you **analyze your security** trends and identify the highest priority security issues.

It **centralizes security related alerts across accounts**, and provides a UI for viewing these. The biggest limitation is it **does not centralize alerts across regions**, only across accounts

**Characteristics**

- Regional (findings don't cross regions)
- Multi-account support
- Findings from:
  - Guard Duty
  - Config
  - Inspector
  - Macie
  - third party
  - self-generated against CIS standards
