## Syncing AzureAD users to on-prem to escalate from on-prem to AzureAD

I order to synchronize a new user f**rom AzureAD to the on-prem AD** these are the requirements:

- The **AzureAD user** needs to have a proxy address (a **mailbox**)
- License is not required
- Should **not be already synced**

```powershell
Get-MsolUser -SerachString admintest | select displayname, lastdirsynctime, proxyaddresses, lastpasswordchangetimestamp | fl
```

When a user like these is found in AzureAD, in order to **access it from the on-prem AD** you just need to **create a new account** with the **proxyAddress** the SMTP email.

An automatically, this user will be **synced from AzureAD to the on-prem AD user**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Notice that to perform this attack you **don't need Domain Admin**, you just need permissions to **create new users**.
>
> Also, this **won't bypass MFA**.
>
> Moreover, this was reported an **account sync is no longer possible for admin accounts**.
