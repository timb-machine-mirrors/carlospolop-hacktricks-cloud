## App Service Basic Information

Azure App Services enables developers to **build, deploy, and scale web applications, mobile app backends, and APIs seamlessly**. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with various Azure tools and services for enhanced functionality and management.

Each app runs inside a sandbox but isolation depends upon App Service plans:

- Apps in Free and Shared tiers run on **shared VMs**
- Apps in Standard and Premium tiers run on **dedicated VMs shared only by apps** in the same App Service plan.
- The Isolated tiers run on **dedicated VMs on dedicated virtual networks**, improving the isolation of the apps.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that **none** of those isolations **prevents** other common **web vulnerabilities** (such as file upload, or injections). And if a **management identity** is used, it could be able to **escalate privileges to them**.

Apps have some interesting configurations:

- **Always On**: Ensures that the app is always running. If not enabled, the app will stop running after 20 minutes of inactivity and will start again when a request is received.
  - This is essential if you have a webjob that needs to run continuously as the webjob will stop if the app stops.
- **SSH**: If enabled, a user with enough permissions can connect to the app using SSH.
- **Debugging**: If enabled, a user with enough permissions can debug the app. However, this is disabled automatically every 48h.
- **Web App + Database**: The web console allows to create an App with a database. In this case it's possible to select the database to use (SQLAzure, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and it also allows you to create an Azure Cache for Redis.
  - The URL containing the credentials for the database and Redis will be stored in the **appsettings**.
- **Container**: It's possible to deploy a container to the App Service by indicating the URL of the container and the credentials to access it.
- **Mounts**: It's possible to create 5 mounts from Storage accounts being these Azure Blob (Read-Only) or Azure Files. The configuration will store the access key over the Storage Account.


## Basic Authentication

When creating a web app (and a Azure function usually) it's possible to indicate if you want **Basic Authentication to be enabled** (disabled by default). This basically **enables SCM (Source Control Manager) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** for the application so it'll be possible to deploy the application using those technologies.

In order to access the SCM and the FTP servers, a **username and password** is required. Therefore, Azure provides some **APIs to get the URLs** to these platforms and the credentials.

The **FTP server doesn’t have any special magic**, just with the valid URL, username and password it’s possible to connect and get read and write permissions over the App environment.

The SCM
It's possible to connect to the SCM using a web browser in `https://<SMC-URL>/BasicAuth` and check all files and deployments in there.

### Kudu

Kudu is the platform that **manages both the SCM and a web and API interface** to manage an App Service, and provides Git-based deployments, remote debugging, and file management capabilities. It's accessible through the SCM URL of defined in the web app.

Note that the Kudu versions used by App Services and by Function Apps are different, being the version of the Function apps much more limited.

Some interesting endpoints you can find in Kudu are:
- `/BasicAuth`: You need to access this path to **login inside Kudu**.
- `/DebugConsole`: A console that allows you to execute commands in the environment where Kudu is running.
  - Note that this environment **doesn't have access** to the metadata service to get tokens.
- `/webssh/host`: A web-based SSH client that allows you to connect inside the container where the app is running.
  - This environment **has access to the metadata service** in order to obtain tokens from the assigned managed identities.
- `/Env`: Get information about the system, app settings, env variables, connection strings and HTTP headers.
- `/wwwroot/`: The root directory of the web app. You can download all the files from here.

Moreover, Kudu used to by opensource in [https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu) but the project was deprecated and comparing the behavior of the current Kudu in Azure with the old one it's possible to see that **several things have already changed**.

## Sources

App Services allow to upload the code as a zip file by default, but it also allows to connect to a third party service and get the code from there.

- The currently supported third party sources are **Github** and **Bitbucket**.
  - You can get the authentication tokens running `az rest --url "https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Web/sourcecontrols?api-version=2024-04-01"`
  - Azure by default will setup a **Github Action** to deploy the code to the App Service every time the code is updated.
- It's also possible to indicate a **remote git repository** (with username and password) to get the code from there.
  - You can get the credentials to the remote repo running `az webapp deployment source show --name <app-name> --resource-group <res-group>` or `az rest --method POST --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<res-group>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<app-name>/config/metadata/list?api-version=2022-03-01" --resource "https://management.azure.com"`
- It's also possible to use an **Azure Repository**.
- It's also possible to configure a **local git repository**.
  - You can get the URL of the git repo with `az webapp deployment source show --name <app-name> --resource-group <res-group>` and it's going to be the SCM URL of the app.
  - To clone it you will need the SCM credentials that you can get with `az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group <res-group> -n <name>`


## Webjobs

Azure WebJobs are **background tasks that run in the Azure App Service environment**. They allow developers to execute scripts or programs alongside their web applications, making it easier to handle asynchronous or time-intensive operations such as file processing, data handling, or scheduled tasks.
There are 2 types of web jobs:
- **Continuous**: Runs indefinitely in a loop and it’s triggered as soon as it’s created. It’s ideal for tasks that require constant processing. However, if the app stops running because Always On is disabled and it hasn’t received a request in the last 20mins, the web job will also stop.
- **Triggered**: Runs on-demand or based on a schedule. It’s best suited for periodic tasks, such as batch data updates or maintenance routines.

Webjobs are very interesting from an attackers perspective as they could be used to **execute code** in the environment and **escalate privileges** to the attached managed identities.

Moreover, it's always interesting to check the **logs** generated by the Webjobs as they could contain **sensitive information**.

## Slots

Azure App Service Slots are used to **deploy different versions of the application** to the same App Service. This allows developers to test new features or changes in a separate environment before deploying them to the production environment.

Moreover, it's possible to route a **percentage of the traffic** to a specific slot, which is useful for A/B testing, and for **backdoor purposes**.

## Azure Function Apps

Basically **Azure Function apps are a subset of Azure App Service** in the web console and if you go to the web console and list all the app services or execute `az webapp list` in az cli you will be able to **see the Function apps also listed in there**.

Therefore, both services actually have mostly the **same configurations, features and options in the az cli**, although they might configure them a bit differently (like default values of appsettings or the use of an Storage Account in the Function apps).

## Examples to generate Web Apps

### Python from local

This tutorial is based on the one from [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli).

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart
cd msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart

# Create webapp from this code
az webapp up --runtime PYTHON:3.9 --sku B1 --logs
```

Logging into the SCM portal or logging via FTP it's possible to see in `/wwwroot` the compressed file `output.tar.gz` that contains the code of the webapp.

> [!TIP]
> Just connecting via FTP and modifying the file `output.tar.gz` isn't enough to change the code executed by the webapp.

**An attacker could download this file, modify it, and upload it again to execute arbitrary code in the webapp.**

### Python from Github

This tutorial is based on the previous one but using a Github repository.

1. Fork the repo msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart in your Github account.
2. Create a new python Web App in Azure
3. In `Deployment Center` change the source, login with Github, select the forked repo and click `Save`.

Like in the previous case, logging into the SCM portal or logging via FTP it's possible to see in `/wwwroot` the compressed file `output.tar.gz` that contains the code of the webapp.

> [!TIP]
> Just connecting via FTP and modifying the file `output.tar.gz` and retriggering a deployment isn't enough to change the code executed by the webapp.
