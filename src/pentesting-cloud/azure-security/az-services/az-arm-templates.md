# Az - ARM Templates / Deployments

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

[From the docs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) To implement **infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions**, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (**JSON**) file that **defines** the **infrastructure** and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources.

### History

If you can access it, you can have **info about resources** that are not present but might be deployed in the future. Moreover, if a **parameter** containing **sensitive info** was marked as "**String**" **instead** of "**SecureString**", it will be present in **clear-text**.

## Search Sensitive Info

Users with the permissions `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/read` and `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read` can **read the deployment history**.

```powershell
Get-AzResourceGroup
Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName <name>

# Export
Save-AzResourceGroupDeploymentTemplate -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP> -DeploymentName <DEPLOYMENT NAME>
cat <DEPLOYMENT NAME>.json # search for hardcoded password
cat <PATH TO .json FILE> | Select-String password
```
