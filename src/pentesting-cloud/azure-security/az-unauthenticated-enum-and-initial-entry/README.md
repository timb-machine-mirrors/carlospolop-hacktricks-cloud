## Azure Tenant

### Tenant Enumeration

There are some **public Azure APIs** that just knowing the **domain of the tenant** an attacker could query to gather more info about it.\
You can query directly the API or use the PowerShell library [**AADInternals**](https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals)**:**

| API                                                                  | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | AADInternals function                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| login.microsoftonline.com/\<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration | **Login information**, including tenant ID                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `Get-AADIntTenantID -Domain <domain>`             |
| autodiscover-s.outlook.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.svc             | **All domains** of the tenant                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `Get-AADIntTenantDomains -Domain <domain>`        |
| login.microsoftonline.com/GetUserRealm.srf?login=\<UserName>         | <p><strong>Login information</strong> of the tenant, including tenant Name and domain <strong>authentication type.</strong><br>If <code>NameSpaceType</code> is <strong><code>Managed</code></strong>, it means <strong>AzureAD</strong> is used.</p> | `Get-AADIntLoginInformation -UserName <UserName>` |
| login.microsoftonline.com/common/GetCredentialType                   | Login information, including **Desktop SSO information**                                                                                                                                                                                              | `Get-AADIntLoginInformation -UserName <UserName>` |

You can query all the information of an Azure tenant with **just one command of the** [**AADInternals**](https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals) **library**:

```powershell
Invoke-AADIntReconAsOutsider -DomainName corp.onmicrosoft.com | Format-Table
```

Output Example of the Azure tenant info:

```
Tenant brand:       Company Ltd
Tenant name:        company
Tenant id:          1937e3ab-38de-a735-a830-3075ea7e5b39
DesktopSSO enabled: True

Name                           DNS   MX    SPF  Type      STS
----                           ---   --    ---  ----      ---
company.com                   True  True  True  Federated sts.company.com
company.mail.onmicrosoft.com  True  True  True  Managed
company.onmicrosoft.com       True  True  True  Managed
int.company.com              False False False  Managed
```

It's possible to observe details about the tenant's name, ID, and "brand" name. Additionally, the status of the Desktop Single Sign-On (SSO), also known as [**Seamless SSO**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso), is displayed. When enabled, this feature facilitates the determination of the presence (enumeration) of a specific user within the target organization.

Moreover, the output presents the names of all verified domains associated with the target tenant, along with their respective identity types. In the case of federated domains, the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the identity provider in use, typically an ADFS server, is also disclosed. The "MX" column specifies whether emails are routed to Exchange Online, while the "SPF" column denotes the listing of Exchange Online as an email sender. It is important to note that the current reconnaissance function does not parse the "include" statements within SPF records, which may result in false negatives.

### User Enumeration

It's possible to **check if a username exists** inside a tenant. This includes also **guest users**, whose username is in the format:

```
<email>#EXT#@<tenant name>.onmicrosoft.com
```

The email is user’s email address where at “@” is replaced with underscore “\_“.

With [**AADInternals**](https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals), you can easily check if the user exists or not:

```powershell
# Check does the user exist
Invoke-AADIntUserEnumerationAsOutsider -UserName "user@company.com"
```

Output:

```
UserName         Exists
--------         ------
user@company.com True
```

You can also use a text file containing one email address per row:

```
user@company.com
user2@company.com
admin@company.com
admin2@company.com
external.user_gmail.com#EXT#@company.onmicrosoft.com
external.user_outlook.com#EXT#@company.onmicrosoft.com
```

```powershell
# Invoke user enumeration
Get-Content .\users.txt | Invoke-AADIntUserEnumerationAsOutsider -Method Normal
```

There are **three different enumeration methods** to choose from:

| Method    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal    | This refers to the GetCredentialType API mentioned above. The default method.                                                                                                                           |
| Login     | <p>This method tries to log in as the user.<br><strong>Note:</strong> queries will be logged to sign-ins log.</p>                                                                                       |
| Autologon | <p>This method tries to log in as the user via autologon endpoint.<br><strong>Queries are not logged</strong> to sign-ins log! As such, works well also for password spray and brute-force attacks.</p> |

After discovering the valid usernames you can get **info about a user** with:

```powershell
Get-AADIntLoginInformation -UserName root@corp.onmicrosoft.com
```

The script [**o365creeper**](https://github.com/LMGsec/o365creeper) also allows you to discover **if an email is valid**.

```powershell
# Put in emails.txt emails such as:
# - root@corp.onmicrosoft.com
python.exe .\o365creeper\o365creeper.py -f .\emails.txt -o validemails.txt
```

**User Enumeration via Microsoft Teams**

Another good source of information is Microsoft Teams.

The API of Microsoft Teams allows to search for users. In particular the "user search" endpoints **externalsearchv3** and **searchUsers** could be used to request general information about Teams-enrolled user accounts.

Depending on the API response it is possible to distinguish between non-existing users and existing users that have a valid Teams subscription.

The script [**TeamsEnum**](https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/TeamsEnum) could be used to validate a given set of usernames against the Teams API.

```bash
python3 TeamsEnum.py -a password -u <username> -f inputlist.txt -o teamsenum-output.json
```

Output:

```
[-] user1@domain - Target user not found. Either the user does not exist, is not Teams-enrolled or is configured to not appear in search results (personal accounts only)
[+] user2@domain - User2 | Company (Away, Mobile)
[+] user3@domain - User3 | Company (Available, Desktop)
```

Furthermore it is possible to enumerate availability information about existing users like the following:

- Available
- Away
- DoNotDisturb
- Busy
- Offline

If an **out-of-office message** is configured, it's also possible to retrieve the message using TeamsEnum. If an output file was specified, the out-of-office messages are automatically stored within the JSON file:

```
jq . teamsenum-output.json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "email": "user2@domain",
  "exists": true,
  "info": [
    {
      "tenantId": "[REDACTED]",
      "isShortProfile": false,
      "accountEnabled": true,
      "featureSettings": {
        "coExistenceMode": "TeamsOnly"
      },
      "userPrincipalName": "user2@domain",
      "givenName": "user2@domain",
      "surname": "",
      "email": "user2@domain",
      "tenantName": "Company",
      "displayName": "User2",
      "type": "Federated",
      "mri": "8:orgid:[REDACTED]",
      "objectId": "[REDACTED]"
    }
  ],
  "presence": [
    {
      "mri": "8:orgid:[REDACTED]",
      "presence": {
        "sourceNetwork": "Federated",
        "calendarData": {
          "outOfOfficeNote": {
            "message": "Dear sender. I am out of the office until March 23rd with limited access to my email. I will respond after my return.Kind regards, User2",
            "publishTime": "2023-03-15T21:44:42.0649385Z",
            "expiry": "2023-04-05T14:00:00Z"
          },
          "isOutOfOffice": true
        },
        "capabilities": ["Audio", "Video"],
        "availability": "Away",
        "activity": "Away",
        "deviceType": "Mobile"
      },
      "etagMatch": false,
      "etag": "[REDACTED]",
      "status": 20000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Azure Services

Know that we know the **domains the Azure tenant** is using is time to try to find **Azure services exposed**.

You can use a method from [**MicroBust**](https://github.com/NetSPI/MicroBurst) for such goal. This function will search the base domain name (and a few permutations) in several **azure service domains:**

```powershell
Import-Module .\MicroBurst\MicroBurst.psm1 -Verbose
Invoke-EnumerateAzureSubDomains -Base corp -Verbose
```

## Open Storage

You could discover open storage with a tool such as [**InvokeEnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1**](https://github.com/NetSPI/MicroBurst/blob/master/Misc/Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1) which will use the file **`Microburst/Misc/permitations.txt`** to generate permutations (very simple) to try to **find open storage accounts**.

```powershell
Import-Module .\MicroBurst\MicroBurst.psm1
Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs -Base corp
[...]
https://corpcommon.blob.core.windows.net/secrets?restype=container&comp=list
[...]

# Access https://corpcommon.blob.core.windows.net/secrets?restype=container&comp=list
# Check: <Name>ssh_info.json</Name>
# Access then https://corpcommon.blob.core.windows.net/secrets/ssh_info.json
```

### SAS URLs

A _**shared access signature**_ (SAS) URL is an URL that **provides access** to certain part of a Storage account (could be a full container, a file...) with some specific permissions (read, write...) over the resources. If you find one leaked you could be able to access sensitive information, they look like this (this is to access a container, if it was just granting access to a file the path of the URL will also contain that file):

`https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/newcontainer?sp=r&st=2021-09-26T18:15:21Z&se=2021-10-27T02:14:21Z&spr=https&sv=2021-07-08&sr=c&sig=7S%2BZySOgy4aA3Dk0V1cJyTSIf1cW%2Fu3WFkhHV32%2B4PE%3D`

Use [**Storage Explorer**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) to access the data

## Compromise Credentials

### Phishing

- [**Common Phishing**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/phishing-methodology) (credentials or OAuth App -[Illicit Consent Grant Attack](az-oauth-apps-phishing.md)-)
