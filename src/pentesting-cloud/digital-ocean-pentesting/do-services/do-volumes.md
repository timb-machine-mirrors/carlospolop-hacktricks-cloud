{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

DigitalOcean volumes are **block storage** devices that can be **attached to and detached from Droplets**. Volumes are useful for **storing data** that needs to **persist** independently of the Droplet itself, such as databases or file storage. They can be resized, attached to multiple Droplets, and snapshot for backups.
