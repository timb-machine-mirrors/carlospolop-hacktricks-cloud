### Access the images

If you can access the container images check the code for vulnerabilities and hardcoded sensitive information. Also for sensitive information in env variables.

If the images are stored in repos inside the service Artifact Registry and the user has read access over the repos, he could also download the image from this service.

### Modify & redeploy the image

Modify the run image to steal information and redeploy the new version (just uploading a new docker container with the same tags won't get it executed). For example, if it's exposing a login page, steal the credentials users are sending.
