# GCP - local privilege escalation ssh pivoting

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

in this scenario we are going to suppose that you **have compromised a non privilege account** inside a VM in a Compute Engine project.

Amazingly, GPC permissions of the compute engine you have compromised may help you to **escalate privileges locally inside a machine**. Even if that won't always be very helpful in a cloud environment, it's good to know it's possible.

## Read the scripts <a href="#follow-the-scripts" id="follow-the-scripts"></a>

**Compute Instances** are probably there to **execute some scripts** to perform actions with their service accounts.

As IAM is go granular, an account may have **read/write** privileges over a resource but **no list privileges**.

A great hypothetical example of this is a Compute Instance that has permission to read/write backups to a storage bucket called `instance82736-long-term-xyz-archive-0332893`.

Running `gsutil ls` from the command line returns nothing, as the service account is lacking the `storage.buckets.list` IAM permission. However, if you ran `gsutil ls gs://instance82736-long-term-xyz-archive-0332893` you may find a complete filesystem backup, giving you clear-text access to data that your local Linux account lacks.

You may be able to find this bucket name inside a script (in bash, Python, Ruby...).

## Custom Metadata

Administrators can add [custom metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata#custom) at the **instance** and **project level**. This is simply a way to pass **arbitrary key/value pairs into an instance**, and is commonly used for environment variables and startup/shutdown scripts.

Moreover, it's possible to add **userdata**, which is a script that will be **executed everytime** the machine is started or restarted and that can be **accessed from the metadata endpoint also.**

## **Abusing IAM permissions**

Most of the following proposed permissions are **given to the default Compute SA,** the only problem is that the **default access scope prevents the SA from using them**. However, if **`cloud-platform`** **scope** is enabled or just the **`compute`** **scope** is enabled, you will be **able to abuse them**.

Check the following permissions:

- [**compute.instances.osLogin**](gcp-compute-privesc/index.html#compute.instances.oslogin)
- [**compute.instances.osAdminLogin**](gcp-compute-privesc/index.html#compute.instances.osadminlogin)
- [**compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata**](gcp-compute-privesc/index.html#compute.projects.setcommoninstancemetadata)
- [**compute.instances.setMetadata**](gcp-compute-privesc/index.html#compute.instances.setmetadata)
- [**compute.instances.setIamPolicy**](gcp-compute-privesc/index.html#compute.instances.setiampolicy)

## Search for Keys in the filesystem

Check if other users have loggedin in gcloud inside the box and left their credentials in the filesystem:

```
sudo find / -name "gcloud"
```

These are the most interesting files:

- `~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db`
- `~/.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/[ACCOUNT]/adc.json`
- `~/.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/[ACCOUNT]/.boto`
- `~/.credentials.json`

### More API Keys regexes

```bash
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/whatever"

# Service account keys
grep -Pzr "(?s){[^{}]*?service_account[^{}]*?private_key.*?}" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Legacy GCP creds
grep -Pzr "(?s){[^{}]*?client_id[^{}]*?client_secret.*?}" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Google API keys
grep -Pr "AIza[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]{35}" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Google OAuth tokens
grep -Pr "ya29\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{100,200}" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Generic SSH keys
grep -Pzr "(?s)-----BEGIN[ A-Z]*?PRIVATE KEY[a-zA-Z0-9/\+=\n-]*?END[ A-Z]*?PRIVATE KEY-----" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Signed storage URLs
grep -Pir "storage.googleapis.com.*?Goog-Signature=[a-f0-9]+" \
    "$TARGET_DIR"

# Signed policy documents in HTML
grep -Pzr '(?s)<form action.*?googleapis.com.*?name="signature" value=".*?">' \
    "$TARGET_DIR"
```
