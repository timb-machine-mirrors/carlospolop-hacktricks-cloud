{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

**Google Cloud Composer** is a fully managed **workflow orchestration service** built on **Apache Airflow**. It enables you to author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across clouds and on-premises data centers. With GCP Composer, you can easily integrate your workflows with other Google Cloud services, facilitating efficient data integration and analysis tasks. This service is designed to simplify the complexity of managing cloud-based data workflows, making it a valuable tool for data engineers and developers handling large-scale data processing tasks.
