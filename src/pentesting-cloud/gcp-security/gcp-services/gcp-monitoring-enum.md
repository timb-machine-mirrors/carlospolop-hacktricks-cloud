# GCP - Monitoring Enum

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Google Cloud Monitoring offers a suite of tools to **monitor**, troubleshoot, and improve the performance of your cloud resources. From a security perspective, Cloud Monitoring provides several features that are crucial for maintaining the security and compliance of your cloud environment:

### Policies

Policies **define conditions under which alerts are triggered and how notifications are sent**. They allow you to monitor specific metrics or logs, set thresholds, and determine where and how to send alerts (like email or SMS).

### Dashboards

Monitoring Dashboards in GCP are customizable interfaces for visualizing the **performance and status of cloud resources**. They offer real-time insights through charts and graphs, aiding in efficient system management and issue resolution.

### Channels

Different **channels** can be configured to **send alerts** through various methods, including **email**, **SMS**, **Slack**, and more.

Moreover, when an alerting policy is created in Cloud Monitoring, it's possible to **specify one or more notification channels**.

### Snoozers

A snoozer will **prevent the indicated alert policies to generate alerts or send notifications** during the indicated snoozing period. Additionally, when a snooze is applied to a **metric-based alerting policy**, Monitoring proceeds to **resolve any open incidents** that are linked to that specific policy.
