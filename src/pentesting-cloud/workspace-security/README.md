### Password Spraying

In order to test passwords with all the emails you found (or you have generated based in a email name pattern you might have discover) you could use a tool like [**https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing**](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) (although it looks unmaintained) which will use AWS lambdas to change IP address.

## Post-Exploitation

If you have compromised some credentials or the session of the user you can perform several actions to access potential sensitive information of the user and to try to escala privileges:

## GWS <--> GCPW |Â GCDS | Directory Sync (AD & EntraID)

- **GCPW (Google Credential Provider for Windows)**: This is the single sign-on that Google Workspaces provides so users can login in their Windows PCs using **their Workspace credentials**. Moreover, this will **store tokens to access Google Workspace** in some places in the PC.
- **GCDS (Google CLoud DIrectory Sync)**: This is a tool that can be used to **sync your active directory users and groups to your Workspace**. The tool requires the **credentials of a Workspace superuser and privileged AD user**. So, it might be possible to find it inside a domain server that would be synchronising users from time to time.
- **Admin Directory Sync**: It allows you to synchronize users from AD and EntraID in a serverless process from [https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories](https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories).
