# GWS - Workspace Sync Attacks (GCPW, GCDS, GPS, Directory Sync with AD & EntraID)

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## GCPW - Google Credential Provider for Windows

This is the single sign-on that Google Workspaces provides so users can login in their Windows PCs using **their Workspace credentials**. Moreover, this will store **tokens** to access Google Workspace in some places in the PC: Disk, memory & the registry... it's even possible to obtain the **clear text password**.

> [!TIP]
> Note that [**Winpeas**](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe) is capable to detect **GCPW**, get information about the configuration and **even tokens**.

## GCSD - Google Cloud Directory Sync

This is a tool that can be used to **sync your active directory users and groups to your Workspace** (and not the other way around by the time of this writing).

It's interesting because it's a tool that will require the **credentials of a Workspace superuser and privileged AD user**. So, it might be possible to find it inside a domain server that would be synchronising users from time to time.

## GPS - Google Password Sync

This is the binary and service that Google offers in order to **keep synchronized the passwords of the users between the AD** and Workspace. Every-time a user changes his password in the AD, it's set to Google.

It gets installed in `C:\Program Files\Google\Password Sync` where you can find the binary `PasswordSync.exe` to configure it and `password_sync_service.exe` (the service that will continue running).

## Admin Directory Sync

The main difference between this way to synchronize users with GCDS is that GCDS is done manually with some binaries you need to download and run while **Admin Directory Sync is serverless** managed by Google in [https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories](https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories).
